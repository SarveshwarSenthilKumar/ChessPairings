🧠 Purpose
A Swiss-system tournament pairs players with similar scores each round, allowing many players to compete fairly and efficiently over a few rounds — without elimination.

🏁 How It Works
📌 Core Principles
All players play every round.

Players are paired with opponents on equal or similar scores.

No one plays the same opponent twice.

Effort is made to alternate colors (white/black) each round.

Number of rounds is fixed before the event (usually log₂(n) + 1).

📋 Before the Tournament
Collect all player names, ratings (if using), and optionally seed the list.

Decide:

Number of rounds (e.g., 5 for 20–30 players).

Tiebreak systems (see below).

Time control (e.g., 10+5 or 90+30).

Ruleset (FIDE, CFC, etc.).

Determine how you'll record results (paper forms, spreadsheet, software).

🔁 Each Round
1. Group by Score
Players are grouped into "score brackets" based on total points so far.

2. Sort Within Each Group
Sort by:

Total score

Then by rating (optional)

Then alphabetically or at random

3. Pair Players
Pair top vs bottom (or nearest) in each group.

Avoid repeat opponents.

Attempt to alternate colors from previous rounds.

4. Assign Byes (if odd number)
One player gets a full-point bye.

Only assign to a player once, ideally to the lowest-ranked eligible.

⚖️ Scoring
Win = 1 point

Draw = 0.5 points

Loss = 0 points

Bye = 1 point (or 0.5 if half-point byes allowed)

⚙️ Color Assignment
Try to alternate colors for each player (W-B-W… or B-W-B…).

If perfect alternation isn’t possible:

Avoid more than two of the same color in a row.

Prefer players who have had fewer whites/blacks so far.

🧮 Tiebreak Systems
Use these only at the end if players are tied in points:

System	Purpose
Buchholz	Sum of opponents' scores.
Median Buchholz	Buchholz, but remove top/bottom opponent score.
Sonneborn-Berger	Score of defeated opponents + ½ of drawn ones.
Head-to-Head	Result of direct match between tied players.
Most Wins	Total number of wins.

Also add options for 
- Single elimination
- Double elimination
- Round robin
